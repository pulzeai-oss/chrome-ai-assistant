# Pulze.ai Chrome Extension

Welcome to the Pulze.ai Chrome Extension open-source project! This extension links directly with your custom AI Spaces, allowing you to connect and expose these spaces as needed. Think of it as a switchboard that lets you decide which Space to utilize when you're in applications like Gmail or WhatsApp. You can always go into your Space and configure or modify it to ensure it remains highly relevant and personalized.

## 🚀 Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Works with Gmail, Smartlead, and WhatsApp Web.
- **AI-Powered Response Generation**: Generate context-aware replies with a single click.
- **Customizable AI Spaces**: Create and manage various AI assistants tailored to your specific needs.
- **Privacy-Focused Design**: Your data stays secure; processing happens on our servers.

## 🏗️ Current Status

We are currently under review in the Chrome Web Store and plan to publish our releases here. In the meantime, anyone interested in testing the local developer mode version can request access by emailing [support@pulze.ai](mailto:support@pulze.ai).

## 🤝 Contributing

We invite the community to help develop this Chrome extension and add more integrations. Here are some examples of how you can contribute:
